# Architecture Overview

## Purpose

Document the architectural components and design decisions for our Kubernetes platform built on Rancher.

## Topics

- **[Rancher Components](rancher-components.md)** - Server, agents, downstream clusters
- **[Cluster Topology](cluster-topology.md)** - Multi-cluster setup (dev/staging/prod)
- **[Hybrid Cloud Model](hybrid-cloud.md)** - On-premise + AWS/Azure integration

## Key Diagrams

[Diagrams will be added as research progresses]

## Open Questions

- [ ] How many downstream clusters do we need?
- [ ] Single Rancher instance or HA setup?
- [ ] Network connectivity requirements for hybrid setup
